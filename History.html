 <br> <br> <h2 style="text-align:center; color: darkgreen;"><strong> History of Kinabatangan</h2></strong>
<p style="text-align:center;">The name Kinabatangan was originally called "Cinabatangan" which means a long river by a Chinese <br> settlement governor in the area named Ong Sum Ping who had arrived to the area in the 16th century.<br> It is believed that the name of Kampung Mumiang, Sukau and Bilit located in the district also comes from <br> the Chinese language</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Kinabatangan was already used by the locals as recorded in the books of French authors in 1782 and 1837,<br> long before the arrival of Chinese immigrants to the area.<br> In addition, Bruneian records record the marriage of Sultan Ahman, Sultan Muhammad's brother, to Princess Kinabatangan,<br> who ruled 1408-1426, also long before the arrival of Chinese immigrants there.<br> The name Kinabatangan is probably from a sentence resulting from the principal name and pronunciation.</p>

   <br> <h2 style="text-align:center; color: darkgreen;">History</h2>
 <p style="text-align:center;">Due to its vast hinterland of jungle and limestone caves, the Kinabatangan floodplain has for centuries assumed strategic economic importance as a source for edible bird’s nests, bee wax, rattan and ivory. Many believe that as China and Borneo has trade links as far back as 631AD, the origin of the name “Kinabatangan” was derived from Kina (China) and Batang (large river). Moreover, based on Chinese records, there existed a Chinese settlement in the area most probably around Sukau.
    Also in the 15th Century, a Chinese princess from the Kinabatangan married the first Sultan of Brunei. Between 1791-1808, the Sultan of Sulu even put his son as governor of this area and later in 1881, British North Borneo Chartered Company took over control of this area and paid US$5,000 per year to the Sultan of Sulu.</p> <br>
