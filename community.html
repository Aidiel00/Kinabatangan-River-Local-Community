    <p>"MESCOT KOPEL is the Community Ecotourism Co-operative initiative
      <br>for the Batu Puteh community in the Lower Kinabatangan.<br>
      It was primarily set up to promote sustainable development with efforts
      <br>to protect the forest habitat, wildlife and biodiversity of the Lower Kinabatangan ecology
      <br>while preserving the livelihood of the local population."
      <br><br>
      There are 4 villages that make up the Batu Puteh community, namely
      <br>Batu Puteh Village, Mengaris Village, Perpaduan Village and Singgah Mata Village.
      <br>These villages have formed their own ecotourism initiatives bringing livelihoods for the locals,
      <br>encouraging skills developments among their community and manage the conservation of forest biodiversity.
      <br>MESCOT KOPEL also combines and coordinates the villages within the Pin Supu Forest Reserve,
      <br>eco-tourism activities such as the Miso Walai Homestay Program, Wayon Tokou Nature Guide Association,
      <br>Mayo do Talud Boat Service, MESCOT Culture Group, Tungog Rainforest Eco Camp and Wetland Lake Rehabilitation.

    <p>Visitors are enticed to visit MESCOT KOPEL because it offers various kind of activities
      <br>and makes any visitors generally feels closer to the knit community. Though conservation is their major effort,
      <br>MESCOT KOPEL can arrange for a homestay experience, eco camp, volunteerism, jungle trekking, river cruising,
      <br>birding, caving and so much more. Their forest restoration programme is an on-going initiative
      <br>to restore degraded floodplain forests. The efforts have resulted in planting more than 100,000 trees 
      <br>across different floodplain forest types and made the volunteering programme with MESCOT KOPEL more enriching.
      <br>For a sense of cultural, adventure, nature, and educational tour,  MESCOT KOPEL offers a unique experience 
      <br>to visitors with a close affinity to environmental conservation.
