  <h2 class="heading-KR" style="text-align:center;">Kinabatangan River</h2>

  <img src="images/River2.jpg" width="50%">

  <p style="text-align:center;color: white;">This 560-kilometer-long river is part of the Sukai-Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary and runs through Sabah state in Malaysian Borneo. <br>It is a simply stunning area to visit and encounter a wide variety of wildlife. The Kinabatangan River has the highest concentration of wildlife in Borneo. <br> While most of the travel and wildlife spotting is from the river, most people stay in riverside lodges and spend several days here. <br>  It’s possible also to take wildlife hikes and the wide variety of habitats provides for diverse wildlife spotting. Taking a Kinabatangan River cruise and tour provides fabulous opportunities to see truly wild animals in their native environment.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;color: white;">At 560km long, Kinabatangan River is Sabah’s longest and Malaysia’s second longest river. Much of the lower Kinabatangan River is gazetted under the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary and it meanders through a flood plain creating numerous ox-bow lakes and making it an ideal environment for some of the best wildlife and birdlife found in Malaysia.</p> <br> <br>
  <h2 class="heading-KR" style="text-align:center;"> Wildlife Spotting on the Kinabatangan River</h2>

  <img src="images/Ele.jpg" width="50%">

  <p style="text-align:center;color: white;"> is a unique place to spot wildlife. The Kinabatangan Reserve is home to a huge variety of birds, crocodiles, proboscis monkeys, orangutans, <br>  and Asia’s smallest elephants to name but a few species that you can expect to find here.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center; color: white;">Pygmy Elephants on the Kinabatangan River
    The pygmy elephants of Borneo are baby-faced with oversized ears, plump bellies, and tails so long they sometimes drag on the ground as they walk. They’re genetically different from other Asian elephants and were isolated more than 300,000 years ago from their cousins on mainland Asia and the island of Sumatra.  They’re the smallest elephants in Asia.  Even when they’re fully grown they look like babies.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;color: white;">The river area, including Labang and Kuamut, were formed by the Early and Middle Miocene periods, while large parts of the river system from the Maliau Basin were formed during the Early and Late Miocene. Towards the river mouth, the area is made of Middle Miocene chaotic deposits. </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;color: white;">The ecology of the upper reaches of the river has been severely disrupted by excessive logging and clearing of land for plantations, <br> although the original lowland forest and mangrove swamps near the coast have largely survived, providing sanctuary for a population of saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) and containing some of Borneo's highest concentrations of wildlife. 
        <p style="text-align:center;color: white;"> In many villages along the river, the demand for freshwater fish has always been high, and the livelihoods of villagers have greatly depended on the income from catches. Each year, the lashing rains of the northeast monsoon cause the river to swell rapidly.Unable to disgorge into the sea quickly enough, the river frequently overflows its banks and spreads across the flat land of its lower reaches, creating a huge floodplain.</p>
